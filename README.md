# blayoo

Blayoo is an online social platform to match content creators and social media influencers. The platform offers influencers and content creators from all genres to monetize their digital content while developing authentic relationships with their audience.

The global platform has been developed with a vision to build One-Platform-for-Content, yet to launch to grow internationally and be a welcoming home for creators and their followers.

As a content creator, there are no fees to join Blayoo, and while we run collaborations across most social networks, we do require the content creators to have a public profile with a minimum of 10,000 followers on social networks, to be eligible for brand collaborations. We also look for content creators with an average engagement rate above 1.0%; however, exceptions exist.
